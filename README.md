# T-DNF a terminal dnf wrapper

This app is directed to user of Dnfdragora witch don't like the long waiting times but are not ready jet to switch to the command line. 

## installation
just copy the script to your PATH and make it executable or simply run it with `./tdnf`. You also can make a short cut with `${TERMINAL} -e /path/to/the/script/tdnf`

I hope you enjoy it and it get you closer to the terminal.
